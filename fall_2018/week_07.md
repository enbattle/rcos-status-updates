## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I ran into a problem with the anaconda prompt when using the carme/docker packages, and it seems that I need to reinstall all of of the packages through linux, and also update the carme packages installation directions to inform future users that there are problems when using Carme through the anaconda prompt.

## This Week's Plan

> Reinstall Carme/Docker packages through the linux system and make sure that all the packages can be used.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing terrible at the moment.
