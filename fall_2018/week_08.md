## Last Week's Accomplishments

> All of the Carme packages and Docker are fully functioning. I have fixed the errors that Carme was having on the Linux platform.
## This Week's Plan

> Now it's time to get started on the compartimentalization of the python workflow with the gofer grader to autograde a student's work. I need to create json configuration files in order to separately grade each question.
## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing terrible at the moment.
