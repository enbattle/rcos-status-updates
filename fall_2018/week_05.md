## Last Week's Accomplishments
I was talking with my group on the differences between Submitty, OKPY, and Gofer Grader. It seems that out of the three,Gofer Grader might be the best option to use an autograding program. The other two don't seem to bring as good of results as the one created by Gofer Grader. 

## This Week's Plan
Implement the Gofer Grader configuration files into JupyterHub and hopefully get some example homewokrs autograded to see Gofer Grader in action.
