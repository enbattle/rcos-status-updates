## Last Week's Accomplishments
 I figured out the various ways that Submitty paths to configuration files to autograde. I am currently in the midst of creating an assignment that will be autograded by Submitty.
## This Week's Plan
  I still need to find a time to meet the Submitty team so that I can talk with them and discuss possible integration. Otherwise, I will have to drop the Submitty and Jupyter Notebook integration and commit myself to upgrading OKPY for Jupyter Notebook. I am also finishing creating an assignment and having Submitty autograde it.
## Anything Blocking?
 No current major blocks.`
