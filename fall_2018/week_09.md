## Last Week's Accomplishments
I was figuring out the workflow that I should go about for the autograder and how to break up the code so that I can separately grade each individual question rather than just trying to figure it out as a whole..
## This Week's Plan
I am starting to write the script for the autograder workflow.
## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing terrible at the moment.
