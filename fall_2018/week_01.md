## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.
> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions


  I was familiarizing myself with the Jupyter and JupyterHub environment. I wanted to see how it would connect with other autograding packages, such as OKPY and Submitty. If I can figure out which autograder is more efficient with Jupyter, then I can implement that autograder and create packages that will help it run more efficiently.
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

  I will try to implement Submitty onto Jupyter to see how it autogrades, and then I will make a decision as to whether or not to pursue OKPY or Submitty.  

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

  No current major blocks.
## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
