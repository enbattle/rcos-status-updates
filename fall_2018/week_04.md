## Last Week's Accomplishments
 I have met with the Submitty team and obtained a deeper understanding of the Submitty workflow, and the nuances when working with Submitty. 
## This Week's Plan
 I have learned about the Submitty workflow that executes when it autogrades. I also learned that Submitty is capable of running multiple command line commands, which will be really helpful in coverting a notebook file into a python file, and finally grading that python file. I will be working on figuring out how to convert a notebook file into a pure python file and running that on the Submitty autograder.
## Anything Blocking?
 No current major blocks.`
