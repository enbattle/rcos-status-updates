## Last Week's Accomplishments
 I was experimenting with Submitty with how it functions as an autograder, like how it accepts files, uploads files, autogrades files, and more. I also was checking out its repository option for uploading files, which would be really beneficial for Jupyter.

## This Week's Plan
  I need to meet with the Submitty team to talk about possible integration with Jupyter so that it can function
as an internal autograder rather than a external program. 

## Anything Blocking?
 No current major blocks.`
